My wife is Italian and she claims it is on par with some of the best wheat-based pasta she has had. My daughter has celiac disease and loved it too. I did notice a slight corn taste, but it was very pleasant and certainly not too pronounced. You could serve this pasta to your guests and they'd have no idea that this is a gluten-free, quinoa-based pasta.<br /><br />This product has tremendous value to us because it uses quinoa flour (one of my favorite \"grains\"), there are only two (2!) ingredients (quinoa and corn flour) that are both are organic, it is produced in a gluten-free facility, tastes great and has great structure (very nice al dente). A perfect combination!<br /><br />This product gets 5 stars and a glowing endorsement from all of us, and we are 2 discriminating foodies and a 7 year old with celiac disease.",

                        "name": "Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />*** Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />+ Not too expensive compared to other bottled water, although it is not cheap either.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />- This bottled water product's labeling, product descriptions, and health claims are misleading.<br /><br />At first glance, this 1.5-liter bottle of water that I am reviewing looks like another one of the many varieties of bottled water on the market.  There are many kinds of bottled water: \"spring water\" produced from an underground formation where the groundwater naturally flows up to the Earth's surface, \"artesian water\" obtained from a well that taps into an underground aquifer, \"mineral water\" produced from a well or spring that naturally contains trace amounts of minerals that some people consider to provide health benefits, \"ground/well water\" produced from a well that tapes into an aquifer, \"sparkling water\" from a spring or well that is naturally carbonated, and \"purified water\" produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or other purification processes.  This Essentia Drinking Water is \"purified water\"; this bottle contains municipal water (i.e. tap water that comes from your faucet) that is purified using reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light for disinfection.<br /><br />The label on this Essentia water bottle is filled with marketing hype and technical terms designed to make it sound exotic:<br />* \"Infused with Electrolytes For A Difference You Can Taste\"<br />* \"Silky Smooth Taste\"<br />* \"Hydrates Better\"<br />* \"Electrolytes Infused\"<br />* \"Best Available pH at 9.5\"<br />* \"Doctor recommended to protect, improve, and enhance the quality of your health.\"<br />* \"Our Proprietary Technology: Water purified by reverse osmosis; infused with electrolytes for taste; alkalinized and restructured using Ionic Separation Technology.\"<br />* \"Ingredients: purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride.\"<br /><br />There are two ways to evaluate this water product.  One way to review this water is based on how it tastes, how safe are its added ingredients, and its cost.  Since Essentia includes a variety of health claims and marketing statements on the water bottle's label, on the Amazon product listing, and on the company's Web site, the veracity of this statements must also be scrutinized since the marketing hype of most other brands of bottled water is just limited to the \"freshness\" or \"purity\" of their taste without making other health-related claims.<br /><br />First, on the basis on its cost, with all of its marketing hype and hoopla, at least this water is not priced far more expensive than most other brands of bottled water.  But there are various other bottled water products on Amazon that cost less on a per-liter basis.  And if you think that this slightly pricey water can be justified based on its health \"merits\", keep reading...<br /><br />As for taste, that can be a highly personal preference, but I like my water to simply taste \"wet\".  :-)  If I want some kind of flavored drink - tea, wine, beer, fruit juice, etc. - I will drink that instead.  But nothing hydrates and quenches as easily as pure and simple water, with no additives or flavorings added to it.  This particular Essentia water does have a smooth texture to it.  Most other bottled waters taste more crisp than this Essentia water.  Again, you may either like the smooth texture of this water or you may think that its texture is rather flat and bland.  Unlike drinking \"distilled water\", or bottled water that was purified using distillation with no additives, this water has a very slight subtle aftertaste that might be considered as either \"chalky\" or \"metallic\".  Those are my highly subjective adjectives that I associate with this water.  I can only surmise that this is due to the small amounts of additives that were used in this water.  This aftertaste is not too objectionable, but if I just want to hydrate myself drinking \"water\", I really prefer my water to be without any identifiable taste, texture, or odor.<br /><br />Next, since this is not just a bottle of pure H2O water, let's consider what was added to this water: sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride.  Sodium bicarbonate is the same thing as baking soda.  This water was made to have a slightly alkaline pH of 9.5 by adding sodium bicarbonate.  People sometimes also adjust and raise the pH of their swimming pool water by adding sodium bicarbonate.  Dipotassium phosphate is sometimes added to various food products as a buffering agent or emulsifier.  In this water, it serves as one of the \"electrolytes\" that is added.  The term \"electrolytes\" is just a subset of minerals that are found in both the Earth and the food that we eat.  Also serving as an electrolyte is the addition of magnesium sulfate.  Magnesium sulfate is sold in drug stores as \"Epsom Salt\", and you can either soak your feet or body in an Epsom Salt bath to soothe sore muscles, or when ingested in larger quantities, magnesium sulfate also can serve as a laxative.  Calcium chloride serves as another electrolyte in this water.  Calcium chloride is sometimes used as a food additive.  The trace amounts of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus in this water do not qualify as a measurable part of your daily nutritional intake of these minerals, regardless of how much of this water you drink each day.<br /><br />Essentia is definitely not the first bottled water manufacturer to add electrolytes to either bottled water or drinks.  During the 1960s, Gatorade was possibly the first large-scale commercial drink that was produced with the goal of adding electrolytes of sodium, sugar, potassium, and phosphate to hydrate and replenish athletes who lost fluids during physical exertion in hot weather.  On Essentia's Web site, they have an FAQ question/answer of: \"Why should I drink Essentia if I get my electrolytes through sports drinks?  Essentia provides a blend of dissolved minerals that emulate the ratio of the body's own mixture and concentration - providing the correct proportion of electrolytes without all the sugars and other additives you typically find in sports and energy drinks.\"  There are several problems with that statement.  First, if you are actively exercising and sweating, your body can actually use those extra calories, and if you are just sitting in front of the computer or television, guzzling Gatorade just adds useless calories and electrolytes.  Second, if you are drinking Essentia at home, this product's claim that it provides \"the correct proportion of electrolytes\" implies a one-size-fits-all balance of electrolytes, which is simply not true as we all have different bodies, diets, and lifestyles.<br /><br />None of what Essentia refers to as \"Our Proprietary Technology\" is really that \"proprietary\" or exotic.  The reverse osmosis purification of municipal tap water is commonly used to produce bottled water, and the addition of various electrolytes or minerals to water has been practiced by other bottled water manufacturers for many decades now.  Some people think that drinking plain distilled water tastes boring and, mentally at least, they like the idea that drinking water that is naturally infused with minerals from a spring or well/aquifer adds an extra measure of health benefits.  The addition of trace minerals do add noticeable flavor that mimics natural spring water.  Also, slightly flavoring the water with minerals masks the residual odors that can be left by the plastic water bottle; the plastic odor is still there, but you notice it less.  The same principle applies to using a room deodorizer to mask the existing odors in a house; that old cat urine smell is still present inside the house, but you notice it less and therefore the house smells fresher.  The most common electrolytes/minerals in spring water are calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfate, and chloride.  The Coca-Cola company markets a \"Dasani\" bottled water that, like this Essentia, is municipal tap water purified via reverse osmosis.  Dasani has magnesium sulfate and potassium chloride added to it.  Perhaps the Dasani taste testing panels decided that their water tastes better without the addition of calcium?  But for whatever reasons, this Essentia water has a slight residual \"chalky\" or \"metallic\" aftertaste, as if it had a tannic undertone like the aftertaste after drinking a dry red wine, that I do not really care for.  I do not want my drinking water to leave a subtle aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />Essentia also competes directly with \"Glaceau Smart Water\", which takes an approach similar to Essentia's water.  Glaceau Smart Water is municipal water purified via distillation, and then infused with the similar ingredients of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, and potassium bicarbonate.<br /><br />Not to be outdone, another of Essentia's alkaline/electrolyte water competitors, named \"NEO Water\" (to ride on the futuristic coattails of \"The Matrix\" fame??), pumps out even more junk science drivel filled with fear-mongering misleading statements, calling itself \"Alkaline, Electrolyte, Antioxidant Super Hydrator ... ultra purified healthy and refreshing water formulated through proprietary technology to balance, revitalize and propel you unlike any traditional water\", and \"NEO's unique antioxidants neutralize free radicals the body releases when under exertion\".  But when you really dig further into NEO Water's claims, there are *NO* antioxidants in NEO Water... just potassium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, which is similar to the mundane chemicals added to Essentia and Dasani water.  NEO Water's marketing nonsense says that its \"alkalinity allows its molecules to carry more oxygen than normal with an extra attached electron (hydroxyl ions). As a result, these molecules are able to seek and neutralize free radicals in your body and prevent free radical damage to your cells. These natural antioxidant benefits leave your body rich in oxygen and energy.\"  Again, like Essentia, NEO Water hopes to blind and persuade the consumer by overwhelming you with exotic totally false techno-babble; it ascribes its antioxidant benefits entirely to its 9.5 pH alkalinity.  So if you really believe in this nonsense, you could, in theory, obtain far more amazing antioxidant protection simply by dissolving an antacid tablet into your tap water once a day.  As with Essentia's water, NEO Water's \"ultra purified\" water is simply municipal tap water purified using the common method of reverse osmosis.<br /><br />This Essentia Drinking Water is not the first product to tout the benefits of \"alkaline water\".  There have been previous highly-hyped products based on ionized water, alkaline water, and combination alkaline-ionized water.  There have even been so-called \"liquid oxygen\" drops that supposedly contained \"O4\" molecules (instead of the \"O2\" oxygen that is in the air) dissolved in a liquid, and by ingesting 10 drops each day, you feel more energized, but this quackery completely ignores the fact that oxygen is best utilized in the lungs, and not in the stomach.  Just as the \"liquid oxygen\" drops are a distorted version of twisted junk science based on the concept of oxygen bars (at least in oxygen bars, you do breathe in the oxygen instead of putting drops of useless oxygen in your stomach), this \"alkaline water\" concept is a distortion of the \"alkaline diet\" alternative medicine belief that the foods we eat can affect the acidity of urine and blood, which can then affect our well-being, susceptibility to disease, and energy level.  If you are an avid vegan/vegetarian practitioner of an alkaline diet, then this 9.5-pH alkaline water can keep your diet on its alkaline-based theme.  But if you regularly eat meats, poultry, seafood, dairy products, eggs, grains, processed sugar foods, and colas/sodas, all of which significantly boost the acidic levels of your food consumption, then drinking a slightly alkaline water makes absolutely no difference to your health.<br /><br />Your stomach has a healthily acidic pH that ranges between 1.45 to 3.5; your stomach must be very acidic to aid in digestion.  However, blood must always be slightly alkaline, with a pH of 7.35 to 7.45.  If the blood's pH drops below 6.8 (more acidic) or rises above 7.8 (more alkaline), death may occur.  But your blood automatically stays within its healthy pH range regardless of what you eat or drink because your blood utilizes several buffering systems.  The most important buffer for maintaining acidity/alkalinity balance in the blood is called the carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer.  To form the bicarbonate in this buffering system, your body uses carbon dioxide... guess what, carbon dioxide is in (over)abundance in the air that you breathe and you do not need sodium bicarbonate baking soda added to your drinking water to maintain a healthy pH in your body.  In fact, consuming too much supplemental sodium bicarbonate can actually lead to constipation, convulsions, diarrhea, frequent urination, and vomiting.  There is only a tiny amount of sodium bicarbonate in each bottle of Essentia water, so you do not have to worry about overdose.  But my point is that all this hoopla and hype about this water being of the \"Best Available pH at 9.5\" is purified nonsense.  Some other fear-mongering alkaline water sales gimmicks claim that, to quote another Web site, \"Excess acidity weakens all our systems and forces the body to take minerals from vital organs and bones to buffer/neutralize the acid and safely remove it from the body.\"  But this is totally false fear-based junk science contrived to mislead you into thinking that your body will rob its vital organs and bones of minerals to neutralize excess acidity.  But our body's carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer simply combines carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air with water to make the blood plasma more acidic if it needs to, and it can prevent excess plasma acidity and raise its pH to be more alkaline by having the lungs convert the bicarbonate back into CO2 which you then breathe out.  A similar phosphate buffering system also helps to maintain the pH of cellular fluids, using phosphate instead of bicarbonate.  Phosphorus is present in nearly all foods, and regardless of whether you like to eat lots of meats or lots of vegetables, you can get plenty of sufficient phosphorus in your diet without needing to add it to your drinking water!<br /><br />Drinking too many acidic drinks such as sodas and colas can have a detrimental effect of eroding your tooth enamel, but guzzling all those colas have absolutely no effect on the pH of your cells and bodily fluids.  And regardless of how much alkalinity you consume and put in your stomach, your body is going to make sure that your stomach stays within a healthy acidic pH range and your body will use its pH buffering systems to keep your blood pH between 7.35 and 7.45 regardless of how much acidic or alkaline food and drink you consume. If you are familiar with logarithms, also realize that the pH scale is logarithmic (pH is not a linear scale) and drinking 9.5 pH water really has no effect on your various bodily fluids compared with drinking tap water or any other bottled water. And if you really could somehow artifically adjust your stomach, blood, and bodily fluids entirely to a 9.5 pH, you would be immediately wheeled into a hospital's emergency room because your body and its stomach cannot handle that kind of alkalinity.<br /><br />If you suffer from frequent heartburn or acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease), drinking this 9.5 pH water will NOT help the least bit.  Your stomach acids need to constantly stay very acidic to maintain proper digestive functions, and the slight alkalinity of this water has no effect on the stomach acid that is entering into the esophagus of people with GERD.<br /><br />Trying to market bottled water based on its \"silky smooth taste\" and \"hydrates better\" claims, its over-hyped \"9.5 pH\" attribute, and all its overexaggerated health claims constitute marketing trickery to fool consumers by utilizing the \"if you believe that it can really work, it does indeed work\" placebo effect.  The placebo effect is a very powerful phenomenon that can frequently affect everything from clinical trials of pharmacological substances to faith healing.  Basically, if you have a hopeful mindset of expectancy and conditioning that makes you think that something will work, then that perception can become 100% of your subjectively observed reality and outcome of the treatment.  For examples of other placebo effects: If I told you that you can get stronger bones by breathing milk through your nose instead of drinking it through your mouth, or if I told you that you could be revitalized by just holding broccoli in your hands for two minutes every day instead of eating it, if you really believe or hope that to be true, then after breathing the milk into your nose or holding the broccoli in your hands, you may think to yourself, \"Gee, I feel better, stronger, and more energetic after having done that!\"  Likewise, if you really HOPE to feel more hydrated after drinking this Essentia water, you may actually feel more refreshed simply because you BELIEVE that this water is hydrating you better than drinking other sources of water, when in fact the tap water from your faucet could have hydrated you just as refreshingly.<br /><br />The Amazon 'Product Description' for this Essentia water falsely states even more overexaggerated health claims: \"Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste.  Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive.  Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance.  It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more.\"  Again... these claims are way wayyyy overexaggerated!  Compared to your overall health, fitness level, and daily food diet, the trace minerals found in this water and this water's slight alkalinity really make no difference in boosting the \"antioxidant properties of your immune system\", nor does it \"help maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more\".  With this litany of false health claims, I am surprised that they also did not pile on claims that this water \"increases libido, cures erectile dysfunction, grows hair on balding men, makes women sexy, and fixes the national debt\" too.<br /><br />Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:<br /><br />I must admit that I personally do not regularly purchase bottled water for home use, even though I will sometimes buy it while I am away from home, both because I think that filtering my tap water through a Brita filter produces water that is just as tasty and healthy as bottled water and, just as important, I think that too much plastic (and petroleum) is used in the production of bottled water and most plastic bottles end up in our overflowing landfills.  Roughly 1.5 million tons of plastic is used to make water bottles.  And this does not include the energy used to make the plastic and the oil used for transporting all the bottled water.  It takes about two liters of water used during the production process just to make one liter of bottled water.  So behind each 1-liter bottle of water is another two liters of water that was expended during its production.  Essentia states that their plastic bottles are \"safe and recyclable\", but we can all reduce our carbon footprint if we drink less bottled water.  In many developing countries, tap water is either unavailable or unsafe, making bottled water a better option if residents cannot boil their tap water before consumption.  But here in the U.S., some bottled water manufacturers, including this Essentia bottled water, use fear-based advertising claims that their water is healthier than tap water, which it really is not.  The concerns for the taste of tap water are valid, however, especially with tap water that has residual smell or taste of chlorination.  But residual smells and taste issues can be easily and economically remedied by using various activated charcoal/carbon filters at home to treat your tap water.  Anyway, the tap water that comes out of my faucet at home is also slightly alkaline like this Essentia water, and many municipal water supplies are also slightly alkaline, so there is no need to purchase this bottled water that has baking soda added to it.<br /><br />This is not a bad bottled water.  It is priced competitively with other bottled waters.  But it has an odd aftertaste that I do not like.  And the techno-jargon claims that revolve around this water's selling points - 9.5 pH, \"ionically separated water\", \"Infused With Electrolytes\", and even falsely stating that this water boosts your immune system - amount to nothing but purified snake oil hogwash.  To quote William Shakespeare, all this marketing hype about 9.5 pH and electrolytes is really \"much ado about nothing\"!",

                  "Text": "Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />*** Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />+ Not too expensive compared to other bottled water, although it is not cheap either.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />- This bottled water product's labeling, product descriptions, and health claims are misleading.<br /><br />At first glance, this 1.5-liter bottle of water that I am reviewing looks like another one of the many varieties of bottled water on the market.  There are many kinds of bottled water: \"spring water\" produced from an underground formation where the groundwater naturally flows up to the Earth's surface, \"artesian water\" obtained from a well that taps into an underground aquifer, \"mineral water\" produced from a well or spring that naturally contains trace amounts of minerals that some people consider to provide health benefits, \"ground/well water\" produced from a well that tapes into an aquifer, \"sparkling water\" from a spring or well that is naturally carbonated, and \"purified water\" produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or other purification processes.  This Essentia Drinking Water is \"purified water\"; this bottle contains municipal water (i.e. tap water that comes from your faucet) that is purified using reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light for disinfection.<br /><br />The label on this Essentia water bottle is filled with marketing hype and technical terms designed to make it sound exotic:<br />* \"Infused with Electrolytes For A Difference You Can Taste\"<br />* \"Silky Smooth Taste\"<br />* \"Hydrates Better\"<br />* \"Electrolytes Infused\"<br />* \"Best Available pH at 9.5\"<br />* \"Doctor recommended to protect, improve, and enhance the quality of your health.\"<br />* \"Our Proprietary Technology: Water purified by reverse osmosis; infused with electrolytes for taste; alkalinized and restructured using Ionic Separation Technology.\"<br />* \"Ingredients: purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride.\"<br /><br />There are two ways to evaluate this water product.  One way to review this water is based on how it tastes, how safe are its added ingredients, and its cost.  Since Essentia includes a variety of health claims and marketing statements on the water bottle's label, on the Amazon product listing, and on the company's Web site, the veracity of this statements must also be scrutinized since the marketing hype of most other brands of bottled water is just limited to the \"freshness\" or \"purity\" of their taste without making other health-related claims.<br /><br />First, on the basis on its cost, with all of its marketing hype and hoopla, at least this water is not priced far more expensive than most other brands of bottled water.  But there are various other bottled water products on Amazon that cost less on a per-liter basis.  And if you think that this slightly pricey water can be justified based on its health \"merits\", keep reading...<br /><br />As for taste, that can be a highly personal preference, but I like my water to simply taste \"wet\".  :-)  If I want some kind of flavored drink - tea, wine, beer, fruit juice, etc. - I will drink that instead.  But nothing hydrates and quenches as easily as pure and simple water, with no additives or flavorings added to it.  This particular Essentia water does have a smooth texture to it.  Most other bottled waters taste more crisp than this Essentia water.  Again, you may either like the smooth texture of this water or you may think that its texture is rather flat and bland.  Unlike drinking \"distilled water\", or bottled water that was purified using distillation with no additives, this water has a very slight subtle aftertaste that might be considered as either \"chalky\" or \"metallic\".  Those are my highly subjective adjectives that I associate with this water.  I can only surmise that this is due to the small amounts of additives that were used in this water.  This aftertaste is not too objectionable, but if I just want to hydrate myself drinking \"water\", I really prefer my water to be without any identifiable taste, texture, or odor.<br /><br />Next, since this is not just a bottle of pure H2O water, let's consider what was added to this water: sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride.  Sodium bicarbonate is the same thing as baking soda.  This water was made to have a slightly alkaline pH of 9.5 by adding sodium bicarbonate.  People sometimes also adjust and raise the pH of their swimming pool water by adding sodium bicarbonate.  Dipotassium phosphate is sometimes added to various food products as a buffering agent or emulsifier.  In this water, it serves as one of the \"electrolytes\" that is added.  The term \"electrolytes\" is just a subset of minerals that are found in both the Earth and the food that we eat.  Also serving as an electrolyte is the addition of magnesium sulfate.  Magnesium sulfate is sold in drug stores as \"Epsom Salt\", and you can either soak your feet or body in an Epsom Salt bath to soothe sore muscles, or when ingested in larger quantities, magnesium sulfate also can serve as a laxative.  Calcium chloride serves as another electrolyte in this water.  Calcium chloride is sometimes used as a food additive.  The trace amounts of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus in this water do not qualify as a measurable part of your daily nutritional intake of these minerals, regardless of how much of this water you drink each day.<br /><br />Essentia is definitely not the first bottled water manufacturer to add electrolytes to either bottled water or drinks.  During the 1960s, Gatorade was possibly the first large-scale commercial drink that was produced with the goal of adding electrolytes of sodium, sugar, potassium, and phosphate to hydrate and replenish athletes who lost fluids during physical exertion in hot weather.  On Essentia's Web site, they have an FAQ question/answer of: \"Why should I drink Essentia if I get my electrolytes through sports drinks?  Essentia provides a blend of dissolved minerals that emulate the ratio of the body's own mixture and concentration - providing the correct proportion of electrolytes without all the sugars and other additives you typically find in sports and energy drinks.\"  There are several problems with that statement.  First, if you are actively exercising and sweating, your body can actually use those extra calories, and if you are just sitting in front of the computer or television, guzzling Gatorade just adds useless calories and electrolytes.  Second, if you are drinking Essentia at home, this product's claim that it provides \"the correct proportion of electrolytes\" implies a one-size-fits-all balance of electrolytes, which is simply not true as we all have different bodies, diets, and lifestyles.<br /><br />None of what Essentia refers to as \"Our Proprietary Technology\" is really that \"proprietary\" or exotic.  The reverse osmosis purification of municipal tap water is commonly used to produce bottled water, and the addition of various electrolytes or minerals to water has been practiced by other bottled water manufacturers for many decades now.  Some people think that drinking plain distilled water tastes boring and, mentally at least, they like the idea that drinking water that is naturally infused with minerals from a spring or well/aquifer adds an extra measure of health benefits.  The addition of trace minerals do add noticeable flavor that mimics natural spring water.  Also, slightly flavoring the water with minerals masks the residual odors that can be left by the plastic water bottle; the plastic odor is still there, but you notice it less.  The same principle applies to using a room deodorizer to mask the existing odors in a house; that old cat urine smell is still present inside the house, but you notice it less and therefore the house smells fresher.  The most common electrolytes/minerals in spring water are calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfate, and chloride.  The Coca-Cola company markets a \"Dasani\" bottled water that, like this Essentia, is municipal tap water purified via reverse osmosis.  Dasani has magnesium sulfate and potassium chloride added to it.  Perhaps the Dasani taste testing panels decided that their water tastes better without the addition of calcium?  But for whatever reasons, this Essentia water has a slight residual \"chalky\" or \"metallic\" aftertaste, as if it had a tannic undertone like the aftertaste after drinking a dry red wine, that I do not really care for.  I do not want my drinking water to leave a subtle aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />Essentia also competes directly with \"Glaceau Smart Water\", which takes an approach similar to Essentia's water.  Glaceau Smart Water is municipal water purified via distillation, and then infused with the similar ingredients of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, and potassium bicarbonate.<br /><br />Not to be outdone, another of Essentia's alkaline/electrolyte water competitors, named \"NEO Water\" (to ride on the futuristic coattails of \"The Matrix\" fame??), pumps out even more junk science drivel filled with fear-mongering misleading statements, calling itself \"Alkaline, Electrolyte, Antioxidant Super Hydrator ... ultra purified healthy and refreshing water formulated through proprietary technology to balance, revitalize and propel you unlike any traditional water\", and \"NEO's unique antioxidants neutralize free radicals the body releases when under exertion\".  But when you really dig further into NEO Water's claims, there are *NO* antioxidants in NEO Water... just potassium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, which is similar to the mundane chemicals added to Essentia and Dasani water.  NEO Water's marketing nonsense says that its \"alkalinity allows its molecules to carry more oxygen than normal with an extra attached electron (hydroxyl ions). As a result, these molecules are able to seek and neutralize free radicals in your body and prevent free radical damage to your cells. These natural antioxidant benefits leave your body rich in oxygen and energy.\"  Again, like Essentia, NEO Water hopes to blind and persuade the consumer by overwhelming you with exotic totally false techno-babble; it ascribes its antioxidant benefits entirely to its 9.5 pH alkalinity.  So if you really believe in this nonsense, you could, in theory, obtain far more amazing antioxidant protection simply by dissolving an antacid tablet into your tap water once a day.  As with Essentia's water, NEO Water's \"ultra purified\" water is simply municipal tap water purified using the common method of reverse osmosis.<br /><br />This Essentia Drinking Water is not the first product to tout the benefits of \"alkaline water\".  There have been previous highly-hyped products based on ionized water, alkaline water, and combination alkaline-ionized water.  There have even been so-called \"liquid oxygen\" drops that supposedly contained \"O4\" molecules (instead of the \"O2\" oxygen that is in the air) dissolved in a liquid, and by ingesting 10 drops each day, you feel more energized, but this quackery completely ignores the fact that oxygen is best utilized in the lungs, and not in the stomach.  Just as the \"liquid oxygen\" drops are a distorted version of twisted junk science based on the concept of oxygen bars (at least in oxygen bars, you do breathe in the oxygen instead of putting drops of useless oxygen in your stomach), this \"alkaline water\" concept is a distortion of the \"alkaline diet\" alternative medicine belief that the foods we eat can affect the acidity of urine and blood, which can then affect our well-being, susceptibility to disease, and energy level.  If you are an avid vegan/vegetarian practitioner of an alkaline diet, then this 9.5-pH alkaline water can keep your diet on its alkaline-based theme.  But if you regularly eat meats, poultry, seafood, dairy products, eggs, grains, processed sugar foods, and colas/sodas, all of which significantly boost the acidic levels of your food consumption, then drinking a slightly alkaline water makes absolutely no difference to your health.<br /><br />Your stomach has a healthily acidic pH that ranges between 1.45 to 3.5; your stomach must be very acidic to aid in digestion.  However, blood must always be slightly alkaline, with a pH of 7.35 to 7.45.  If the blood's pH drops below 6.8 (more acidic) or rises above 7.8 (more alkaline), death may occur.  But your blood automatically stays within its healthy pH range regardless of what you eat or drink because your blood utilizes several buffering systems.  The most important buffer for maintaining acidity/alkalinity balance in the blood is called the carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer.  To form the bicarbonate in this buffering system, your body uses carbon dioxide... guess what, carbon dioxide is in (over)abundance in the air that you breathe and you do not need sodium bicarbonate baking soda added to your drinking water to maintain a healthy pH in your body.  In fact, consuming too much supplemental sodium bicarbonate can actually lead to constipation, convulsions, diarrhea, frequent urination, and vomiting.  There is only a tiny amount of sodium bicarbonate in each bottle of Essentia water, so you do not have to worry about overdose.  But my point is that all this hoopla and hype about this water being of the \"Best Available pH at 9.5\" is purified nonsense.  Some other fear-mongering alkaline water sales gimmicks claim that, to quote another Web site, \"Excess acidity weakens all our systems and forces the body to take minerals from vital organs and bones to buffer/neutralize the acid and safely remove it from the body.\"  But this is totally false fear-based junk science contrived to mislead you into thinking that your body will rob its vital organs and bones of minerals to neutralize excess acidity.  But our body's carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer simply combines carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air with water to make the blood plasma more acidic if it needs to, and it can prevent excess plasma acidity and raise its pH to be more alkaline by having the lungs convert the bicarbonate back into CO2 which you then breathe out.  A similar phosphate buffering system also helps to maintain the pH of cellular fluids, using phosphate instead of bicarbonate.  Phosphorus is present in nearly all foods, and regardless of whether you like to eat lots of meats or lots of vegetables, you can get plenty of sufficient phosphorus in your diet without needing to add it to your drinking water!<br /><br />Drinking too many acidic drinks such as sodas and colas can have a detrimental effect of eroding your tooth enamel, but guzzling all those colas have absolutely no effect on the pH of your cells and bodily fluids.  And regardless of how much alkalinity you consume and put in your stomach, your body is going to make sure that your stomach stays within a healthy acidic pH range and your body will use its pH buffering systems to keep your blood pH between 7.35 and 7.45 regardless of how much acidic or alkaline food and drink you consume. If you are familiar with logarithms, also realize that the pH scale is logarithmic (pH is not a linear scale) and drinking 9.5 pH water really has no effect on your various bodily fluids compared with drinking tap water or any other bottled water. And if you really could somehow artifically adjust your stomach, blood, and bodily fluids entirely to a 9.5 pH, you would be immediately wheeled into a hospital's emergency room because your body and its stomach cannot handle that kind of alkalinity.<br /><br />If you suffer from frequent heartburn or acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease), drinking this 9.5 pH water will NOT help the least bit.  Your stomach acids need to constantly stay very acidic to maintain proper digestive functions, and the slight alkalinity of this water has no effect on the stomach acid that is entering into the esophagus of people with GERD.<br /><br />Trying to market bottled water based on its \"silky smooth taste\" and \"hydrates better\" claims, its over-hyped \"9.5 pH\" attribute, and all its overexaggerated health claims constitute marketing trickery to fool consumers by utilizing the \"if you believe that it can really work, it does indeed work\" placebo effect.  The placebo effect is a very powerful phenomenon that can frequently affect everything from clinical trials of pharmacological substances to faith healing.  Basically, if you have a hopeful mindset of expectancy and conditioning that makes you think that something will work, then that perception can become 100% of your subjectively observed reality and outcome of the treatment.  For examples of other placebo effects: If I told you that you can get stronger bones by breathing milk through your nose instead of drinking it through your mouth, or if I told you that you could be revitalized by just holding broccoli in your hands for two minutes every day instead of eating it, if you really believe or hope that to be true, then after breathing the milk into your nose or holding the broccoli in your hands, you may think to yourself, \"Gee, I feel better, stronger, and more energetic after having done that!\"  Likewise, if you really HOPE to feel more hydrated after drinking this Essentia water, you may actually feel more refreshed simply because you BELIEVE that this water is hydrating you better than drinking other sources of water, when in fact the tap water from your faucet could have hydrated you just as refreshingly.<br /><br />The Amazon 'Product Description' for this Essentia water falsely states even more overexaggerated health claims: \"Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste.  Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive.  Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance.  It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more.\"  Again... these claims are way wayyyy overexaggerated!  Compared to your overall health, fitness level, and daily food diet, the trace minerals found in this water and this water's slight alkalinity really make no difference in boosting the \"antioxidant properties of your immune system\", nor does it \"help maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more\".  With this litany of false health claims, I am surprised that they also did not pile on claims that this water \"increases libido, cures erectile dysfunction, grows hair on balding men, makes women sexy, and fixes the national debt\" too.<br /><br />Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:<br /><br />I must admit that I personally do not regularly purchase bottled water for home use, even though I will sometimes buy it while I am away from home, both because I think that filtering my tap water through a Brita filter produces water that is just as tasty and healthy as bottled water and, just as important, I think that too much plastic (and petroleum) is used in the production of bottled water and most plastic bottles end up in our overflowing landfills.  Roughly 1.5 million tons of plastic is used to make water bottles.  And this does not include the energy used to make the plastic and the oil used for transporting all the bottled water.  It takes about two liters of water used during the production process just to make one liter of bottled water.  So behind each 1-liter bottle of water is another two liters of water that was expended during its production.  Essentia states that their plastic bottles are \"safe and recyclable\", but we can all reduce our carbon footprint if we drink less bottled water.  In many developing countries, tap water is either unavailable or unsafe, making bottled water a better option if residents cannot boil their tap water before consumption.  But here in the U.S., some bottled water manufacturers, including this Essentia bottled water, use fear-based advertising claims that their water is healthier than tap water, which it really is not.  The concerns for the taste of tap water are valid, however, especially with tap water that has residual smell or taste of chlorination.  But residual smells and taste issues can be easily and economically remedied by using various activated charcoal/carbon filters at home to treat your tap water.  Anyway, the tap water that comes out of my faucet at home is also slightly alkaline like this Essentia water, and many municipal water supplies are also slightly alkaline, so there is no need to purchase this bottled water that has baking soda added to it.<br /><br />This is not a bad bottled water.  It is priced competitively with other bottled waters.  But it has an odd aftertaste that I do not like.  And the techno-jargon claims that revolve around this water's selling points - 9.5 pH, \"ionically separated water\", \"Infused With Electrolytes\", and even falsely stating that this water boosts your immune system - amount to nothing but purified snake oil hogwash.  To quote William Shakespeare, all this marketing hype about 9.5 pH and electrolytes is really \"much ado about nothing\"!",

Some other fear-mongering alkaline water sales gimmicks claim that, to quote another Web site, \"Excess acidity weakens all our systems and forces the body to take minerals from vital organs and bones to buffer/neutralize the acid and safely remove it from the body.\"  But this is totally false fear-based junk science contrived to mislead you into thinking that your body will rob its vital organs and bones of minerals to neutralize excess acidity.  But our body's carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer simply combines carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air with water to make the blood plasma more acidic if it needs to, and it can prevent excess plasma acidity and raise its pH to be more alkaline by having the lungs convert the bicarbonate back into CO2 which you then breathe out.  A similar phosphate buffering system also helps to maintain the pH of cellular fluids, using phosphate instead of bicarbonate.  Phosphorus is present in nearly all foods, and regardless of whether you like to eat lots of meats or lots of vegetables, you can get plenty of sufficient phosphorus in your diet without needing to add it to your drinking water!<br /><br />Drinking too many acidic drinks such as sodas and colas can have a detrimental effect of eroding your tooth enamel, but guzzling all those colas have absolutely no effect on the pH of your cells and bodily fluids.  And regardless of how much alkalinity you consume and put in your stomach, your body is going to make sure that your stomach stays within a healthy acidic pH range and your body will use its pH buffering systems to keep your blood pH between 7.35 and 7.45 regardless of how much acidic or alkaline food and drink you consume. If you are familiar with logarithms, also realize that the pH scale is logarithmic (pH is not a linear scale) and drinking 9.5 pH water really has no effect on your various bodily fluids compared with drinking tap water or any other bottled water. And if you really could somehow artifically adjust your stomach, blood, and bodily fluids entirely to a 9.5 pH, you would be immediately wheeled into a hospital's emergency room because your body and its stomach cannot handle that kind of alkalinity.<br /><br />If you suffer from frequent heartburn or acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease), drinking this 9.5 pH water will NOT help the least bit.  Your stomach acids need to constantly stay very acidic to maintain proper digestive functions, and the slight alkalinity of this water has no effect on the stomach acid that is entering into the esophagus of people with GERD.<br /><br />Trying to market bottled water based on its \"silky smooth taste\" and \"hydrates better\" claims, its over-hyped \"9.5 pH\" attribute, and all its overexaggerated health claims constitute marketing trickery to fool consumers by utilizing the \"if you believe that it can really work, it does indeed work\" placebo effect.  The placebo effect is a very powerful phenomenon that can frequently affect everything from clinical trials of pharmacological substances to faith healing.  Basically, if you have a hopeful mindset of expectancy and conditioning that makes you think that something will work, then that perception can become 100% of your subjectively observed reality and outcome of the treatment.  For examples of other placebo effects: If I told you that you can get stronger bones by breathing milk through your nose instead of drinking it through your mouth, or if I told you that you could be revitalized by just holding broccoli in your hands for two minutes every day instead of eating it, if you really believe or hope that to be true, then after breathing the milk into your nose or holding the broccoli in your hands, you may think to yourself, \"Gee, I feel better, stronger, and more energetic after having done that!\"  Likewise, if you really HOPE to feel more hydrated after drinking this Essentia water, you may actually feel more refreshed simply because you BELIEVE that this water is hydrating you better than drinking other sources of water, when in fact the tap water from your faucet could have hydrated you just as refreshingly.<br /><br />The Amazon 'Product Description' for this Essentia water falsely states even more overexaggerated health claims: \"Essentia Water provides unmatched hydration, health benefits and smooth taste.  Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive.  Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance.  It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more.\"  Again... these claims are way wayyyy overexaggerated!  Compared to your overall health, fitness level, and daily food diet, the trace minerals found in this water and this water's slight alkalinity really make no difference in boosting the \"antioxidant properties of your immune system\", nor does it \"help maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more\".  With this litany of false health claims, I am surprised that they also did not pile on claims that this water \"increases libido, cures erectile dysfunction, grows hair on balding men, makes women sexy, and fixes the national debt\" too.<br /><br />Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:<br /><br />I must admit that I personally do not regularly purchase bottled water for home use, even though I will sometimes buy it while I am away from home, both because I think that filtering my tap water through a Brita filter produces water that is just as tasty and healthy as bottled water and, just as important, I think that too much plastic (and petroleum) is used in the production of bottled water and most plastic bottles end up in our overflowing landfills.  Roughly 1.5 million tons of plastic is used to make water bottles.  And this does not include the energy used to make the plastic and the oil used for transporting all the bottled water.  It takes about two liters of water used during the production process just to make one liter of bottled water.  So behind each 1-liter bottle of water is another two liters of water that was expended during its production.  Essentia states that their plastic bottles are \"safe and recyclable\", but we can all reduce our carbon footprint if we drink less bottled water.  In many developing countries, tap water is either unavailable or unsafe, making bottled water a better option if residents cannot boil their tap water before consumption.  But here in the U.S., some bottled water manufacturers, including this Essentia bottled water, use fear-based advertising claims that their water is healthier than tap water, which it really is not.  The concerns for the taste of tap water are valid, however, especially with tap water that has residual smell or taste of chlorination.  But residual smells and taste issues can be easily and economically remedied by using various activated charcoal/carbon filters at home to treat your tap water.  Anyway, the tap water that comes out of my faucet at home is also slightly alkaline like this Essentia water, and many municipal water supplies are also slightly alkaline, so there is no need to purchase this bottled water that has baking soda added to it.<br /><br />This is not a bad bottled water.  It is priced competitively with other bottled waters.  But it has an odd aftertaste that I do not like.  And the techno-jargon claims that revolve around this water's selling points - 9.5 pH, \"ionically separated water\", \"Infused With Electrolytes\", and even falsely stating that this water boosts your immune system - amount to nothing but purified snake oil hogwash.  To quote William Shakespeare, all this marketing hype about 9.5 pH and electrolytes is really \"much ado about nothing\"!",

                  "Text": "Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />*** Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />+ Not too expensive compared to other bottled water, although it is not cheap either.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />- This bottled water product's labeling, product descriptions, and health claims are misleading.<br /><br />At first glance, this 1.5-liter bottle of water that I am reviewing looks like another one of the many varieties of bottled water on the market.  There are many kinds of bottled water: \"spring water\" produced from an underground formation where the groundwater naturally flows up to the Earth's surface, \"artesian water\" obtained from a well that taps into an underground aquifer, \"mineral water\" produced from a well or spring that naturally contains trace amounts of minerals that some people consider to provide health benefits, \"ground/well water\" produced from a well that tapes into an aquifer, \"sparkling water\" from a spring or well that is naturally carbonated, and \"purified water\" produced by distillation, deionization, reverse osmosis, or other purification processes.  This Essentia Drinking Water is \"purified water\"; this bottle contains municipal water (i.e. tap water that comes from your faucet) that is purified using reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light for disinfection.<br /><br />The label on this Essentia water bottle is filled with marketing hype and technical terms designed to make it sound exotic:<br />* \"Infused with Electrolytes For A Difference You Can Taste\"<br />* \"Silky Smooth Taste\"<br />* \"Hydrates Better\"<br />* \"Electrolytes Infused\"<br />* \"Best Available pH at 9.5\"<br />* \"Doctor recommended to protect, improve, and enhance the quality of your health.\"<br />* \"Our Proprietary Technology: Water purified by reverse osmosis; infused with electrolytes for taste; alkalinized and restructured using Ionic Separation Technology.\"<br />* \"Ingredients: purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, calcium chloride.\"<br /><br />There are two ways to evaluate this water product.  One way to review this water is based on how it tastes, how safe are its added ingredients, and its cost.  Since Essentia includes a variety of health claims and marketing statements on the water bottle's label, on the Amazon product listing, and on the company's Web site, the veracity of this statements must also be scrutinized since the marketing hype of most other brands of bottled water is just limited to the \"freshness\" or \"purity\" of their taste without making other health-related claims.<br /><br />First, on the basis on its cost, with all of its marketing hype and hoopla, at least this water is not priced far more expensive than most other brands of bottled water.  But there are various other bottled water products on Amazon that cost less on a per-liter basis.  And if you think that this slightly pricey water can be justified based on its health \"merits\", keep reading...<br /><br />As for taste, that can be a highly personal preference, but I like my water to simply taste \"wet\".  :-)  If I want some kind of flavored drink - tea, wine, beer, fruit juice, etc. - I will drink that instead.  But nothing hydrates and quenches as easily as pure and simple water, with no additives or flavorings added to it.  This particular Essentia water does have a smooth texture to it.  Most other bottled waters taste more crisp than this Essentia water.  Again, you may either like the smooth texture of this water or you may think that its texture is rather flat and bland.  Unlike drinking \"distilled water\", or bottled water that was purified using distillation with no additives, this water has a very slight subtle aftertaste that might be considered as either \"chalky\" or \"metallic\".  Those are my highly subjective adjectives that I associate with this water.  I can only surmise that this is due to the small amounts of additives that were used in this water.  This aftertaste is not too objectionable, but if I just want to hydrate myself drinking \"water\", I really prefer my water to be without any identifiable taste, texture, or odor.<br /><br />Next, since this is not just a bottle of pure H2O water, let's consider what was added to this water: sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride.  Sodium bicarbonate is the same thing as baking soda.  This water was made to have a slightly alkaline pH of 9.5 by adding sodium bicarbonate.  People sometimes also adjust and raise the pH of their swimming pool water by adding sodium bicarbonate.  Dipotassium phosphate is sometimes added to various food products as a buffering agent or emulsifier.  In this water, it serves as one of the \"electrolytes\" that is added.  The term \"electrolytes\" is just a subset of minerals that are found in both the Earth and the food that we eat.  Also serving as an electrolyte is the addition of magnesium sulfate.  Magnesium sulfate is sold in drug stores as \"Epsom Salt\", and you can either soak your feet or body in an Epsom Salt bath to soothe sore muscles, or when ingested in larger quantities, magnesium sulfate also can serve as a laxative.  Calcium chloride serves as another electrolyte in this water.  Calcium chloride is sometimes used as a food additive.  The trace amounts of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus in this water do not qualify as a measurable part of your daily nutritional intake of these minerals, regardless of how much of this water you drink each day.<br /><br />Essentia is definitely not the first bottled water manufacturer to add electrolytes to either bottled water or drinks.  During the 1960s, Gatorade was possibly the first large-scale commercial drink that was produced with the goal of adding electrolytes of sodium, sugar, potassium, and phosphate to hydrate and replenish athletes who lost fluids during physical exertion in hot weather.  On Essentia's Web site, they have an FAQ question/answer of: \"Why should I drink Essentia if I get my electrolytes through sports drinks?  Essentia provides a blend of dissolved minerals that emulate the ratio of the body's own mixture and concentration - providing the correct proportion of electrolytes without all the sugars and other additives you typically find in sports and energy drinks.\"  There are several problems with that statement.  First, if you are actively exercising and sweating, your body can actually use those extra calories, and if you are just sitting in front of the computer or television, guzzling Gatorade just adds useless calories and electrolytes.  Second, if you are drinking Essentia at home, this product's claim that it provides \"the correct proportion of electrolytes\" implies a one-size-fits-all balance of electrolytes, which is simply not true as we all have different bodies, diets, and lifestyles.<br /><br />None of what Essentia refers to as \"Our Proprietary Technology\" is really that \"proprietary\" or exotic.  The reverse osmosis purification of municipal tap water is commonly used to produce bottled water, and the addition of various electrolytes or minerals to water has been practiced by other bottled water manufacturers for many decades now.  Some people think that drinking plain distilled water tastes boring and, mentally at least, they like the idea that drinking water that is naturally infused with minerals from a spring or well/aquifer adds an extra measure of health benefits.  The addition of trace minerals do add noticeable flavor that mimics natural spring water.  Also, slightly flavoring the water with minerals masks the residual odors that can be left by the plastic water bottle; the plastic odor is still there, but you notice it less.  The same principle applies to using a room deodorizer to mask the existing odors in a house; that old cat urine smell is still present inside the house, but you notice it less and therefore the house smells fresher.  The most common electrolytes/minerals in spring water are calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfate, and chloride.  The Coca-Cola company markets a \"Dasani\" bottled water that, like this Essentia, is municipal tap water purified via reverse osmosis.  Dasani has magnesium sulfate and potassium chloride added to it.  Perhaps the Dasani taste testing panels decided that their water tastes better without the addition of calcium?  But for whatever reasons, this Essentia water has a slight residual \"chalky\" or \"metallic\" aftertaste, as if it had a tannic undertone like the aftertaste after drinking a dry red wine, that I do not really care for.  I do not want my drinking water to leave a subtle aftertaste in my mouth.<br /><br />Essentia also competes directly with \"Glaceau Smart Water\", which takes an approach similar to Essentia's water.  Glaceau Smart Water is municipal water purified via distillation, and then infused with the similar ingredients of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, and potassium bicarbonate.<br /><br />Not to be outdone, another of Essentia's alkaline/electrolyte water competitors, named \"NEO Water\" (to ride on the futuristic coattails of \"The Matrix\" fame??), pumps out even more junk science drivel filled with fear-mongering misleading statements, calling itself \"Alkaline, Electrolyte, Antioxidant Super Hydrator ... ultra purified healthy and refreshing water formulated through proprietary technology to balance, revitalize and propel you unlike any traditional water\", and \"NEO's unique antioxidants neutralize free radicals the body releases when under exertion\".  But when you really dig further into NEO Water's claims, there are *NO* antioxidants in NEO Water... just potassium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, which is similar to the mundane chemicals added to Essentia and Dasani water.  NEO Water's marketing nonsense says that its \"alkalinity allows its molecules to carry more oxygen than normal with an extra attached electron (hydroxyl ions). As a result, these molecules are able to seek and neutralize free radicals in your body and prevent free radical damage to your cells. These natural antioxidant benefits leave your body rich in oxygen and energy.\"  Again, like Essentia, NEO Water hopes to blind and persuade the consumer by overwhelming you with exotic totally false techno-babble; it ascribes its antioxidant benefits entirely to its 9.5 pH alkalinity.  So if you really believe in this nonsense, you could, in theory, obtain far more amazing antioxidant protection simply by dissolving an antacid tablet into your tap water once a day.  As with Essentia's water, NEO Water's \"ultra purified\" water is simply municipal tap water purified using the common method of reverse osmosis.<br /><br />This Essentia Drinking Water is not the first product to tout the benefits of \"alkaline water\".  There have been previous highly-hyped products based on ionized water, alkaline water, and combination alkaline-ionized water.  There have even been so-called \"liquid oxygen\" drops that supposedly contained \"O4\" molecules (instead of the \"O2\" oxygen that is in the air) dissolved in a liquid, and by ingesting 10 drops each day, you feel more energized, but this quackery completely ignores the fact that oxygen is best utilized in the lungs, and not in the stomach.  Just as the \"liquid oxygen\" drops are a distorted version of twisted junk science based on the concept of oxygen bars (at least in oxygen bars, you do breathe in the oxygen instead of putting drops of useless oxygen in your stomach), this \"alkaline water\" concept is a distortion of the \"alkaline diet\" alternative medicine belief that the foods we eat can affect the acidity of urine and blood, which can then affect our well-being, susceptibility to disease, and energy level.  If you are an avid vegan/vegetarian practitioner of an alkaline diet, then this 9.5-pH alkaline water can keep your diet on its alkaline-based theme.  But if you regularly eat meats, poultry, seafood, dairy products, eggs, grains, processed sugar foods, and colas/sodas, all of which significantly boost the acidic levels of your food consumption, then drinking a slightly alkaline water makes absolutely no difference to your health.<br /><br />Your stomach has a healthily acidic pH that ranges between 1.45 to 3.5; your stomach must be very acidic to aid in digestion.  However, blood must always be slightly alkaline, with a pH of 7.35 to 7.45.  If the blood's pH drops below 6.8 (more acidic) or rises above 7.8 (more alkaline), death may occur.  But your blood automatically stays within its healthy pH range regardless of what you eat or drink because your blood utilizes several buffering systems.  The most important buffer for maintaining acidity/alkalinity balance in the blood is called the carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer.  To form the bicarbonate in this buffering system, your body uses carbon dioxide... guess what, carbon dioxide is in (over)abundance in the air that you breathe and you do not need sodium bicarbonate baking soda added to your drinking water to maintain a healthy pH in your body.  In fact, consuming too much supplemental sodium bicarbonate can actually lead to constipation, convulsions, diarrhea, frequent urination, and vomiting.  There is only a tiny amount of sodium bicarbonate in each bottle of Essentia water, so you do not have to worry about overdose.  But my point is that all this hoopla and hype about this water being of the \"Best Available pH at 9.5\" is purified nonsense.  Some other fear-mongering alkaline water sales gimmicks claim that, to quote another Web site, \"Excess acidity weakens all our systems and forces the body to take minerals from vital organs and bones to buffer/neutralize the acid and safely remove it from the body.\"  But this is totally false fear-based junk science contrived to mislead you into thinking that your body will rob its vital organs and bones of minerals to neutralize excess acidity.  But our body's carbonic-acid-bicarbonate buffer simply combines carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air with water to make the blood plasma more acidic if it needs to, and it can prevent excess plasma acidity and raise its pH to be more alkaline by having the lungs convert the bicarbonate back into CO2 which you then breathe out.  A similar phosphate buffering system also helps to maintain the pH of cellular fluids, using phosphate instead of bicarbonate.  Phosphorus is present in nearly all foods, and regardless of whether you like to eat lots of meats or lots of vegetables, you can get plenty of sufficient phosphorus in your diet without needing to add it to your drinking water!<br /><br />Drinking too many acidic drinks such as sodas and colas can have a detrimental effect of eroding your tooth enamel, but guzzling all those colas have absolutely no effect on the pH of your cells and bodily fluids.  And regardless of how much alkalinity you consume and put in your stomach, your body is going to make sure that your stomach stays within a healthy acidic pH range and your body will use its pH buffering systems to keep your blood pH between 7.35 and 7.45 regardless of how much acidic or alkaline food and drink you consume.

                        "name": "This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",

What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash.

I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them.

For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed \"high-end\" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like \"liver flavor\" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",

But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me!

I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up.

I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results.

We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term \"all about tuna fish\".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.

However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is \"sweet\" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.

But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.",

I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG\">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ\">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",

I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM.

Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.",

We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY\">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.",

But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  There are some great suggestions mentioned by other reviewers, like mint for example.",

After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea!

The large, hard nuggets had cleaned the plaque from her teeth. Her gums were no longer red, but pink and healthy. Hill's did what was needed. I am thrilled with the results.<br /><br />Yes, this food is expensive, but so is a teeth cleaning bill for a cat, as well as dental problems if you don't. Once my cat's mouth improved, I cut back on the Hill's. I feed my cat a main diet of Purina dry, but I still give her 8-10 Hill's nuggets a day. She's been on this mixed diet for one year and her teeth and gums are still good and healthy. The Hill's large nuggets act like a tooth brush that scrapes against the cat's teeth.<br /><br />Pound per pound this cat food is actually less expensive than those little bags of tarter control cat treats you buy in the supermarket. Once you get control over your cat's dental problems you can maintain her by giving her several Hill's Dental Diet nuggets a day.

The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",

                  "Text": "I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the \"One Star\" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of \"United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers\"....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the \"Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum\"! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a \"Potato Chip Diet\".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!",

Since this bar is raw all of the fat,protein and sugar have not been denatured  which means you get the full health benefit. As far as being high calorie , considering how nutrient dense these babies are I don't consider 200 calories high in calories at all. For me 200 calories is a perfect number allowing it to be used an nutrient dense snack or a quick meal on the go.<br /><br />Concerning these supposedly being high glycemic , sure , if you were to eat the dates in these by themselves it would be , but the nuts in them bring the glycemic load of the entire bar way down , which is another benefit of the healthy fats in these bars , it allows for the sugars to be released slower and for it to digest slower making you feel full and satisfied longer.<br /><br />As far as these not being any better than a candybar I say noway! No preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup , etc, in these babies , just a healthy combo of fruit and nuts. How many nutrients does a candybar have ? Now look at the nutrient in these , loaded with minerals . Also, unlike many other foods these aren't naturally low in nutrients and then \"fortified\" with man made vitamins and minerals to make them then appear healthy. All the nutrients in these are naturally occuring which gives you the benefits in a synergistic way where other healthy compounds such as flavonoids and phenols work together with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />People need to let go of the old dogma which makes them think all fat is bad but if it's sugar free then it MUST be good. If that were true then cotton candy , pepsi and skittles would all be great for ya !Fruit and nuts makes for a good healthy breakfast or snack. I'll eat my greens/green smoothies in the other meals of the day. A person shouldn't eat only fruit and nuts during the day but they shouldn't only eat greens either . These bars help make it easy to strike a balance in your diet on the go. Larabars, Pure bars , SmartMonkey bars and ThinkOrganic bars are all healthy brands of raw bars that amazon sells and all worth a try .

I like my tea on the weak side, so I brew on the 10 oz. or 12 oz. setting - even so, the bergamot taste is still very strong (almost too much). If you are looking for Earl Grey K-cups and don't mind caffeine, I would try the Celestial Seasonings or Bigelow brands - they are better.

Both of these fruits can share the spotlight - but only when they are ripe, juicy and flavourful! Why did I pick some of the messiest fruits to be my favourite?<br /><br />Luckily, the only thing that gets messy when I whip up a cup of this matcha is my cup and whisk! (...and my white shirt. That's a story for another time) But hey! Virtually mess free! At least it's not all over my face... although this matcha is delicious enough that I wouldn't mind sticking my face into a huge bowl of it. Oh yes, can you tell that I am happy with this matcha? So happy! The flavour is sweet and true watermelon flavour! I like watermelon candies, but I hate watermelon jolly ranchers (too chemically), so I was very happy that this flavour lies between a watermelon flavouring and a real watermelon. That doesn't really make sense, but I guess you'll have to take my word for it lol.<br /><br />Making this hot with a sprinkle of sugar takes it into treat territory! Seriously delicious matcha that has me drooling just thinking about it! Another great summer treat. Chopping up some watermelon to make a watermelon puree to go with this matcha (and a splash of vodka) is definitely on my to-do list.<br /><br />I prefer my watermelon fruit straight from the fridge and icy cold, so it goes without saying that my favourite way to prepare this drink is ICED. I still haven't gotten into the habit of just mixing matcha with cold water - so I mix it up double strong with 170 F water, add ice cubes and top with more water. This gives me a perfect result every time - no clumps (if I drink it right away!) and smooth as the rind of an in season watermelon. Oh yes, I went there.<br /><br />For an extra treat, I experimented with cream and tried a \"watermelon and cream\" dessert tea. It was delicious! Let it be known - any fruit + cream = wonder! Too bad most flavours stick to strawberries&cream or peaches&cream, because I think I'm on to something here ;)<br />This also went well with vanilla soy milk and plain almond milk! I'm not picky - I always buy almond milk when it's on sale because it's so delish, creamy, and doesn't affect my acid reflux! That's the joy of these flavoured matchas - delicious flavour minus the calories! They don't need milk and sugar to tantalize my tastebuds - even the basic matcha is smooth, grassy and even creamy!",

I don't measure, but after taste testing, I find I have to use my largest set of tall and wide cups (these little packets make a lot of iced coffee for one person!) The first one I made with a whole packet seemed to at LEAST be Venti sized, and that was BEFORE I added the ice. It was crazy big. So I've started to make two servings with each packet, which doubles the value.<br /><br />The biggest surprise: this stuff mixes VERY well VERY quickly. You won't have any grit in your glass at all. And it hardly tastes instant. I enjoy the level of sweetness it comes with. When I bought this, I did not realize it was pre-sweetened, and I was nervous for a moment. I was afraid it would have a really strong sugar or fake sweetener aftertaste. But luckily, the amount of sweetness is perfect! It definitely has sugar, but it is not THAT much sugar. It actually could have been much worse. This is obviously not a health drink!

The spice level is nice, for those of us who like our food hot and spicy, and you can always add more paste if you want more kick.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: Vegetable oil, cilantro, salt, tamarind, water, cumin, turmeric, chile pepper, ground ginger, garlic powder, maize flour, spices, acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid.<br /><br />And here is a basic recipe from the label:<br /><br />Shrimp Vindaloo, serves 2<br /><br />1 medium onion, diced<br />2 tbsp vegetable oil<br />8 oz. fresh shrimp, peeled (or any other meat)<br />3/4 cup water<br />4 tbsp Patak's hot vindaloo curry paste<br />1/2 cup diced canned tomatoes<br />hot, cooked rice<br /><br />Saute onion in oil. Add shrimp and saute until pink. Stir in curry paste and cook about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and water. Simmer, uncovered until the shrimp is cooked, about 5 minutes. Serve over hot, cooked rice.<br /><br />I tried it with beef (which you'd never be able to order at an Indian restaurant) and simmered for 25 minutes, and it turned out pretty well. Not exactly restaurant quality, but very good for a prepared paste. I now keep Patak's paste and some tomatoes on hand, in case I want to whip up a quick, spicy dish using leftover roast chicken or beef. I look forward to trying the other Patak's pastes.",

And sometimes you're cooking, say, sausages (bangers & mash, anyone??) or something else that isn't going to result in juices you can make gravy from, and yet you still require a big jug of gravy to pour over everything. Lucky for all concerned, the marvellous product that is Bisto exists. I'm English (but have lived in the US for the past several years) and am very happy that this product is reasonably easy to obtain over here. My American husband is an enormous fan and starts to get a bit worried if we don't have at least one unopened tub of Bisto in the cupboard, lest he should want bangers & mash or toad in the hole for dinner and find we're unable to make enough gravy to float a small boat to accompany it.<br /><br />Bisto does come in a few different varieties, but these \"favourite\" granules are the original and work really well as an all-purpose gravy. I prefer to use this version no matter what meat I'm cooking - it works just as well with chicken or turkey as it does with beef or with pork sausages, and it's an essential ingredient in shepherd's pie (lamb), cottage pie (beef), steak \"pot\" pie (as they call it over here), you can throw a spoonful in the crockpot when making a stew... it's very versatile and adds a lovely rich, deep flavor to all kinds of dishes.<br /><br />When making gravy, you can have a jug of the stuff ready within a couple of minutes if you do it the easy way (boil kettle, pour boiling water over a couple of spoonfuls of Bisto granules, stir quickly) but for REALLY good gravy I prefer to soften some onion and garlic in a little butter (just let it sweat over a low heat in a covered pan) until it caramelises slightly, then dump in the Bisto granules and boiling water, give it a good stir, and you will have some heavenly gravy ready to go. Only takes a few minutes. Even better is if you use the water from boiling vegetables and stir in meat juices from the roasting pan if you have some, but it works just as well without.<br /><br />The downside of this product (if you care about such things) is that it's pretty high on the sodium content and has a few artificial flavorings etc in there. As far as I'm concerned: meh. It tastes great, I'm sparing with the salt just about everywhere else in my diet, and I don't use Bisto in great enough quantities to worry about it.<br /><br />In short: Bisto is a wonderful taste of home, and while I could live without it, I'd really rather not!",

Speed is the name of the game in the shower for me...no 5, 10 or 15 minute showers.  Get in and get out.  Just like at the mall.<br /><br />However, this body wash may have me extending my shower time.  It smells good, not \"nice\" but good.  Not manly per se, but not girly either. It lathers quickly and holds the suds.<br /><br />Now for the kicker.  I live in a dry climate and would always have to use lotion on my hands by the time I had gotten to work.  I haven't had to use it since I've been using this body wash!  Great news for me as I can kill two birds with one stone.<br /><br />All in all, I really could care less about my shower routine and how I smell coming out.

We were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke, I mean our coconut water, and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff.

So it was that I had high hopes for Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee.  The coffee had a strong, lovely vanilla aroma upon opening the bag of ground coffee.  I quickly prepared myself a cup and sat down with much anticipation at enjoying some wonderful coffee.  Well... it's coffee.  I guess that's about all I can say about it.  The actual coffee part of the 'taste experience' seemed humdrum.  Starbucks is known for robust coffees, but this was lackluster at best.  And while the vanilla scent was strong upon opening the package, the vanilla flavor is all but dissipated upon brewing.  There is a hint of vanilla flavor upon drinking, but it's not enough in my opinion.  I can smell it more than I can taste it by quite a bit.<br /><br />Perhaps some of the 'infusion' was lost due to the coffee being already ground when bagged, which I've heard causes the coffee to lose some of its flavor very quickly, but can't state that for a fact since I buy only whole beans and grind them myself (this product wasn't available in whole bean to try).  Overall, I was disappointed and would not recommend this to anyone who likes some body and rich flavor to their coffee or likes a distinctly flavored coffee, and I won't be buying it in future.",

The soy sauce was all I used other than a pinch of pepper and it was all that was needed.  Kikkoman's is flavorful without being overly salty. (That's a lot coming from me being as I can't stand overly salty foods or condiments.) It's no where near as salty as those soy sauce condiment packets you get at the restaurants.<br /><br />I actually found myself adding more after the dish was done to add more flavor.<br /><br />I think the sauce is a tad pricey, so if you can find it cheaper elsewhere, great.",

I have read that it is a good habit, as it helps clean your teeth after meals and prevent cavities, and may even help prevent acid reflux. Chewing cinnamon gum has even been shown to boost mental performance in a study. However, I became concerned about the possible heath risks from artificial sweeteners like potassium acesulfame used in the gum available at local stores, so I was chewing less often. I decided to try this Xlear Spry cinnamon gum, sweetened with Xylitol. According to Wikipedeia, xylitol has a lot of heath benefits, including reducing dental caries, ear and upper respiratory infections, and Candida yeast growth; it also helps remineralize teeth and bones.  I am happy with Spry cinnamon gum as a substitute for the name-brand gums I had bought previously, though it isn't perfect.  I do have to chew two pieces, as the gum seems to shrink over time, and the flavor is pleasant but doesn't seem to be quite as strong or last as long.  Also the cost of Spry is higher, since I can't take advantage of sales and coupons like with other gum.  These are minor complaints, though, and I am happily switching my family to healthier xylitol-based gum.",

So, I thought this was worth a try, despite the seemingly bloated health boasts on the label.<br /><br />First, this tastes like normal filtered water -nothing special. Then, there's the health claims -since I only had one bottle of this and I didn't have the opportunity to see if it makes a difference over time. But let me put it this way: in the harsh Texas heat, this water didn't seem to make a difference at all when it came to hydration, health or anything else. Maybe it's just the heat, but I seemed to have the same benefits as drinking regular (and not-so-expensive) water from the store brand. Perhaps, if I used this over a period of time I would be able to see a difference, but since Vine only sent one bottle it's a little difficult to tell.<br /><br />Verdict: this is an over-priced item that promises more health benefits than it actually delivers.

I live in a little town in the midwest that doesn't even have a Starbucks, but I have a gold Starbucks card.  I would check every route when travelling to plan stops for this iced tea.  I have purchased the quart sized bags from Starbucks and Target when available and ordered the gallon bags when that was my only option to brew this tea daily.  I started noticing a change when I was in South Carolina in March, 2012.  I thought maybe southerners just have a different tea preference.  I then noticed it in Nashville over the summer.  Since I spend time regularly in Nashville, I knew a change was on the way.  The tea has lost its crispness and citrus finish.  It seems Starbucks has purchased Tazo from Steven Smith and decided to change it.  I hate to think it was to make more money with a cheaper blend, but I haven't been able to find another reason.  Given the fact that I was paying over $3.00 per Trenta, I can't imagine the mark up was unfair to them no matter what the cost of the original tea.  By buying Tazo, Starbucks cut out the middle man to make way for more profits, then made major change.  Couldn't it just have started its own tea brand?  It has lost a loyal customer in me (and many transfers from my bank account to the Starbucks card).  If you are loyal to taste rather than brand, start your search for a new tea.  I have started my search with the former owner of Tazo who has opened a new business.  Maybe the old formula will come back before we find something we like better.",

You pour one vile into a 16-20 oz bottle of water and the stuff fizzes like crazy!  If you don't get the lid on fast enough, you'll quickly find there will be a mess!  I've found using a wide mouthed nalgene bottle is the best way to prevent these types of accidents.<br /><br />In addition to the massive amounts of Vitamin B12, it has a good amount of Vitamin C (500mg), Niacin (10mg), Vitamin B6 (2.5mg), Calcium (60mg), Magnesium (100mg), and Potassium (905mg).  It has almost every water soluble vitamin meaning that a lot of the excess that your body doesn't utilize, will be flushed through your kidneys.  With that being said, drink a lot of liquid with this and don't over use the product (company recommends no more than 3 a day) or the chance of getting kidney stones exists.<br /><br />It has a 317mg \"proprietary\" blend blend of L-Arginine, L-Taurine, Caffeine from guarana, Alpha-lipoic acid, Grape seed extract, Green tea leaf extract, Ginger root, and Ginseng root.  I don't know how much each compound contributes to the 317mg but they do acknowledge that 100mg of it is caffeine (about the same as a cup of coffee).<br /><br />There are multiple flavors but I'm partial to Grape and Orange Soda.

We also now need to teach her patience, slight portion control techniques (\"One at a time, sweetie!\" works fine, thankfully!), and taking one's time to enjoy their food.  :)  Here are our thoughts:<br />1) Lightly sweetened, when compared to other brands and flavors.  In fact, I'm pretty sensitive to over-sweetened foods, and I likened these to regular Cheerios with a hint of sugar and other flavors.<br />2) I'm able to interpret the toughest of often-unpronouncable ingredients found in many \"food\" products these days, but that's just me since it has a tie to my current occupation.  So, I was surprised at how simple and straightforward the ingredient list is; I'd encourage purchase of this organic product based upon that alone (assuming that the company is truthful in its advertising).  Although our child appears to eat whatever is placed in front of her (this is her daddy's sense of adventure already poking through), I'm not worried about her getting enough greens into her developing body; however, if your child is fussy about veggies, this could be a nice substitute until you find a more creative way to blend in greens into the child's diet (current articles appear to lean more towards \"trickery,\" \"disguising,\" and \"entertaining\" the child when it comes to getting them to eat foods which we ordinarily would have had forced down our throats -so to speak- when we were little!).  This product may partially solve that issue.<br />3) Like competitor brands, this product does \"melt\" into a newly teething baby's mouth within an appropriate amount of time whether it's chewed or sucked upon by the baby, rendering it less of a choking hazard if you're concerned about that as we once were.<br />4) The container itself contains more product per container than do its competitors, which is quite nice.  Depending upon where you purchase a competitor brand, this one may be slightly higher per ounce, but it's worth it.  We don't forsee a need to purchase another case until 1-2 months pass.<br />5) The containers themselves are rather durable.  Unless your child is body-slamming it to the ground or you're stepping on it with all your weight, don't count on it shattering easily at all.  Plus, it's conveniently recyclable, and the opening is not too flimsy and snaps closed well enough.",

Of all the sweeteners I've tried it IS actually the closest to the taste of sugar, with the least noticeable aftertaste. It does measure like sugar, too, as advertised on the package.<br />However, baked goods made with the granular, confectioners' and brown sugar mixtures of Ideal product were unsatisfactory. Cookies made measure for measure with Ideal were mealy and did not brown. There's no way to get a crisp cookie or moist cake because the xylitol does not carmelize, so the only texture it contributes is dry grainy-ness. I suppose the radio chef raved about the product because he was trying to sell his cookbook dealing with the use of xylitol as a sugar substitute.<br />I will continue using Ideal in my coffee, but not for baking.

I love the fact that you can collapse it to make it easier to carry with you.  It comes with a lid to cover the infuser while the tea is steeping, keeping the tea nice and hot.  The holes in the infuser are so small!  If you use a good quality loose leaf tea, I don't think you will have any problem with bits of tea leaves getting through.  The little handle on top is kind of odd.  I am not sure why it doesn't go the other way but you can use it to pick the infuser up out of the tea when you are done brewing.  It does displace a lot of water, so fill your cup up as much as you can while the infuser is in the cup.  The shape does allow the tea leaves to open up during the steeping process which gives you a great cup of tea.  Love it! Will use it all the time!",

I don't know if it can all be blamed on the matcha, but the matcha is the only real change I've made recently. When a tea company makes claims about the healthiness of their teas and how this tea will make you skinny or that tea will calm your anger, I tend to just laugh it off. Just another marketing ploy, I mean, really, it's just tea. It's delicious and better for you than soda (if you don't weigh it down with tons of sugar and cream like I used to do), but it's still just tea, not some magic potion that's going to solve all of your problems.<br /><br />Well. Since matcha came into my life, I'm more alert (obviously) and my system seems...cleaner. I don't feel bogged down by the terrible foods I sometimes indulge in, and somehow my system seems less responsive to my dairy allergy. Don't get me wrong, it still makes me sick, but it's not the gut-wrenching \"I'm gonna die\" feeling I'm used to, it's more of a \"Oh man, I forgot and ate dairy again\". On the whole, I just feel healthier. Which is awesome. Everyone can afford to feel a little bit healthier, am I right?<br /><br />Anyway, this tea smells amazing. Like juicy Granny Smith apples, sweet and tart all at the same time. I want to dip this tea in caramel. The flavor is perfect. It's exactly what I expected this tea to taste like. It's very juicy, my mouth is watering after every sip, and it's tart without being stomach-turning sour. I am having a really hard time not adding some of my Red Leaf Tea Caramel matcha to this. They're just begging to be blended. In college, I was big fan of the Caramel Apple shot, which is basically one part sour apple Pucker to one part butterscotch Schnapps. This seems like a good alternative for me to take to work and not get fired! Though now I'm wondering about matcha cocktails...<br /><br />I love these matchas that are encouraging me to mix and match, play with different blends, bake...I love it! I wish I had the time to just lock myself in my kitchen with my matchas and experiment to my little heart's content.",

Let me warn you so you dont waste your money like I did - DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. #1, not even one of these products contains ANY Watermelon. They are all basically the same with Sugar, Lemon juice, Melon flavoring (NOT Watermelon), and red dye. NOT one single bit of Watermelon in any of them. #2, They dont taste even remotely like Watermelon, and in fact all but Best Bargain have disgusting taste to them. I tried various quantities of the syrup from very little to a lot - and either way, they taste horrible! #3, you can EASILY make your own delicious Watermelon syrup. There are a number of recipies on the web. Some require rendering (boiling down) but you dont have to use those to get a very good homemade, TRUE tasting syrup.<br /><br />Avoid these products like the plague!!!<br /><br />Note - Dunkin Donuts does not seem to sell their syrup, however you can go to their web site and click the \"Contact Us\" button and send them a note that you would like to purchase their syrup (if you like it - and it is the best) and if you have a local shop, you can ask the manager if he/she wouldnt mind buying an extra one for you!<br /><br />Otherwise, make your own! Its the only way to get good taste. However, these products, Monin, Torani, DaVinci and Best Bargain are horrible and while they look like transmission fluid - I will wager THAT tastes better!",

I'd much rather be able to purchase my coffee as needed and at the local grocer.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark, just as they did with the Caramel Flavored Natural Fusions. The Vanilla Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no vanilla odor and has even less vanilla taste. Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging. In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup. This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the vanilla flavor. Rather, this coffee is a very good coffee, but does not have any layers of other flavors, either subtle or more noticeable.  For those looking for a flavored coffee which disguises the taste of coffee, this is definitely not for you.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew. If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's website and put the word \"fusions\" in the search box.

That said, it tastes like water, but with a metallic tinge to it.  It's not bad, but it's something I personally don't like tasting in my water.  If I had to say a water tasted \"silky smooth\", I would immediately turn to Voss water, but that's just me.<br /><br />All in all, it's still water, and if offered it, I would drink it.  But I do ding some stars for taste, hype, and cost.  It's probably cheaper to buy a reverse osmosis distiller over time - at least you can filter enough water the entire family!",

This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.",
